## Local development

JupyterLab App bundles JupyterLab front-end and a conda environment as JupyterLab App Server as its backend into an Electron application.

`<platform>`: mac, linux or win

- Get the project source code

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_app.git
    ```

- Install dependencies and build JupyterLab App

    ```bash
    yarn
    yarn build
    ```

- Create the JupyterLab App Server installer using

    ```bash
    yarn create_env_installer:<platform>
    ```

    Installer will be created in one of `env_installer/JupyterLabAppServer<version>-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`, `env_installer/JupyterLabAppServer-<version>-Linux-x86_64.sh`, `env_installer/JupyterLabAppServer-<version>-Windows-x86_64.exe` based on your platform

- Run the installer to install the JupyterLab App Server. Make sure to set install location to `jlab_server` directory that is at the same level as `jupyterlab_app` project source code

- Now you can launch the JupyterLab App locally using:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

## Building for distribution

- Build the application

    ```bash
    yarn run clean && yarn build
    ```

- Create JupyterLab App Server installer

    ```bash
    yarn create_env_installer:<platform>
    ```

- Create JupyterLab App installer which will also bundle JupyterLab App Server installer.

    ```bash
    yarn dist:<platform>
    ```

    App Installer will be created in `dist/JupyterLab.pkg` (macOS), `dist/JupyterLab.deb` (Debian, Ubuntu), `dist/JupyterLab.rpm` (Red Hat, Fedora) and `dist/JupyterLab-Setup.exe` (Windows) based on the platform
